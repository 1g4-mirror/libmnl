Features:
- Minimalistic Netlink library
- Low-level: you have to know how Netlink works.
- Simplicity: as opposed to complexity.
- Very low abstraction: try to leak as less Netlink details as possible.
- Decoupling: the main bricks are decoupled to avoid inter-dependencies
(eg. socket handling and callbacks are not attached).
